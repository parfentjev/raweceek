# Rawe Ceek

This project was inspired by the [Rawe Ceek meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rawe-ceek). It provides an API service that returns upcoming racing sessions, and a web application that checks if there's a race happening this week. [Check it out](https://raweceek.eu/), the design is awesome!

I don't have major development plans for this project. However, I learned how to automatically generate models and interfaces for Spring Boot services, so it was worth my time!
